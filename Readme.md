### Workflow Explanation

1. The user selects an option from the menu in **Main.java**.
2. `Main.java` collects the user input.
3. The request is sent to **StudentDAO.java**.
4. `StudentDAO.java` uses **DBConnection.java** to connect to the MySQL database.
5. The SQL query is executed.
6. The database returns the result.
7. The result is displayed back to the user through `Main.java`.
